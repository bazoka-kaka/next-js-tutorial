# Custom 404 Page

First you have to go to the pages then create a file called: 404.jsx
<br><br>
This is an especially named file because like index.jsx it doesn't display the route as /404, instead it's gonna be redirected there when an error occur (page not found)
<br><br>
The 404.jsx page:

```
import Link from "next/link";

const NotFound = () => {
  return (
    <div className="not-found">
      <h1>Ooops...</h1>
      <h2>That page cannot be found!</h2>
      <p>
        Go back to the{" "}
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Homepage</a>
        </Link>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NotFound;
```
