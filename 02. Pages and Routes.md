# Pages and Routes

pages folder is where we create
all of the components
<br><br>
each page in nextjs is driven by a react component.
e.g: about page, then create about component, index page, then create index component, etc
<br><br>
each page component is tied to the route for that page. e.g: you have About component, then we can go to localhost:3000/about.
exception: index.js which is not a new route, but the root route (localhost:3000/)

## Creating Page Component

to create a stateless functional component

```
sfc
```

then press enter in your code editor
(you have to install react snippets first in vsc)

### note

when you have subfolder in your pages folder, then you have to add the folder name in your route, for example:<br>
<code>
pages --> subfolder --> test.js
</code>
<br>
then you have to do this in your browser route:
<br>
localhost:3000/subfolder/test
<br><br>
you can also add index file into your subfolder which will just make your subfolder's name as the route name.<br>
example:<br>
<code>
pages --> subfolder --> index.js
</code>
<br>
then you have to do this in your browser route:
localhost:3000/subfolder
