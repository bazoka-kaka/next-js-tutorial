# Dynamic routes part 2

When we build our app for production, next needs to be able to generate a route and an html page for each of the contacts.
but next doesn't automatically know what routes and html pages to generate because that depends on external data. this is because nextjs doesn't know what's in our data when building these pages,
that's being stored somewhere in the internet. only that after we fetched the data that we know the number of pages to be created.
<br><br>
we can tell the detail at build time using a function called <code>getStaticPaths()</code>

## Start Coding

This is the code inside \[id\].jsx:

```
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
  const data = await res.json();

  const paths = data.map((contact) => {
    return {
      params: { id: contact.id.toString() },
    };
  });

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
};

const Contact = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Details page</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Contact;
```

the fallback property is todo with fallback pages, if we set it to false, when the user goes to an id that doesn't exist, it'll show the 404 page.
