# Adding Styles

you can add css to next project
in various different ways. you can use global stylesheet (available to all pages),
styles jsx (makes you able to write css in components), css modules (each components could have each of its own unique scoped stylesheet).
<br><br>
here we're gonna mix global stylesheed and css modules.
<br><br>
the file name for global style is globals.css in styles directory

## Global CSS

you have to import your globals.css file in your \_app.js for it to work as a global stylesheet. this is because here, you're rendering every page of your nextjs application.
<br>
inside \_app.js:

```
import '../styles/globals.css'
```

## CSS Modules

This is all about page specific styles.
<br><br>
css modules allow us to write sheet for each page component or section
then we import that stylesheet into whatever component needs it.
<br><br>
next is automatically gonna scope those files to that component by adding random characters next to the className and selectors.
<br>
example of a class name:
<code>Home_title\_\_T09hD</code>
<br><br>
Those styles are gonna only apply on that specific part or page.
<br><br>
you don't have to worry about classname conflict
<br><br>
convention to write the stylesheet file name: \[name\].module.css
<br>
example of importing it in index.js:

```
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css
```

The selectors must be pure selectors meaning you need to use class selectors and not element selectors.
<br>
you can't do this:

```
p {
  color: white;
}
```

you have to do this instead:

```
.text {
  color: white;
}
```
