# Linking Between Pages

To link page components, we use a special component called Link component.
<br><br>
Link component adds the ability to do client-side navigation
in the browser.
<br><br>
meaning different pages are loaded in the javascript
and not new html page request to the server.
<br><br>
This is gonna make a faster website experience when loading between different pages.

## How to do this

first, import the Link component from Nextjs

```
import Link from 'next/link'
```

then surround the anchor tags with the link component then add the href to the link you wanna direct to.

<br>
inside Navbar.jsx:

```
import Link from "next/link";

const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <div className="logo">
        <h1>My List</h1>
      </div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/contacts">
        <a>Contacts</a>
      </Link>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Navbar;
```

## Code Splitting

by default, next automatically code splits our app.<br><br>
so the only javascript needed
for the current page is served from the server.<br><br> only will when we navigate to the other page, will it serve the javascript for that page.
<br><br>
each page has its own javascript bundle which controls that page, and it only get served to us
once we navigate to that page for the first time.
<br><br>
when you build your next app for production, next is also gonna fetch any code in the background
that might be needed when the user
clicks on a link to another page.
