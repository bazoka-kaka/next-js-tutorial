# Dynamic Routes part 1

We're gonna create a page for each contacts and a route for each one of those, to do that, we're gonna have to create route parameters.

## Dynamic Routes

the routes that we need to generate for these details pages are gonna look like this: <code>/ninjas/id</code>
<br><br>
id is a changeable part of the route
for example:
<code>/ninjas/1</code>

## Static Site Generation

once we completed developing our app,
next is gonna generate static sites for us for each of the page components that we made. next is gonna render our page javascript files into html and javascript bundles that works with them. now we have static sites.
<br><br>

## Start coding

first we have to make the template file for each page, we can do that by naming our page component file within the square brackets (meaning that its name is changeable to the id for each different pages). the file name is
<code>[id].jsx</code> (place this within contacts folder)

inside \[id\].jsx:

```
const Contact = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Details page</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Contact;
```

inside contacts/index.jsx:

```
import Head from "next/head";
import styles from "../../styles/Contacts.module.css";
import Link from "next/link";

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const url = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
  const data = await url.json();

  return {
    props: { contacts: data },
  };
};

const Contacts = ({ contacts }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>myApp | Contacts</title>
        <meta name="keywords" content="myApp" />
      </Head>
      <div>
        <h1>Contacts Page</h1>
        {contacts.map((contact) => {
          return (
            <Link href={`/contacts/${contact.id}`} key={contact.id}>
              <a className={styles.single}>
                <h3>{contact.name}</h3>
                <p>Email: {contact.email}</p>
              </a>
            </Link>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Contacts;
```

notice that the link is going to contacts/\[id\]
