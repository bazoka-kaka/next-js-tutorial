# Images and Metadata

to work with images, we have to use static assets, to use them, we just have to put them in the public folder. and anything that is inside the public folder is made accessible from the browser.
<br><br>
instead of using the regular html "img" component, we can use something called "Image" component within our page components.

## Using the next/image property

you have to import it first

```
import Image from 'next/image';
```

to use it, you have to specify the width and height which also make it responsive.
<br><br>
another reason to use it is that it'll automatically lazy load the image.
<br><br>
lazy load meaning the image is only gonna be loaded when we scroll to it
and we need to see it on the webpage. This is gonna optimize the loading speed.

## Metadata

maybe sometimes you wanna have different titles for each page component.
<br><br>
we can use the head component that's built in the next.
<br><br>
we have to import it in each of the page component, then we can place
any title or metadata inside it.
<br><br>
importing Head element:

```
import Head from "next/head";
```

example of using Head component:

```
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>myApp | Home</title>
        <meta name="keywords" content="myApp" />
      </Head>
      <div>
        <p>This is the page's content</p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```
