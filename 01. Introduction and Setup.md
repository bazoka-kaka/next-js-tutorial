# Introduction and Setup

## What is Nextjs?

- framework to create prerendered react websites
- offers us both side server rendering and static site generation
  (ssr) & (ssg)

### note

server side rendering = when react components
are rendered into html pages on the server after
a page request comes from the browser<br><br>
static side generation = when components are rendered into
html pages at build time, so we can just deploy the webpages
and javascript bundle to the web
<br><br>
meaning: our react components are already rendered into html pages by the time they reached the browser.
(Then the app can behave more like an spa [Single Page Application])

### without next

without next, react would just
render component in the browser instead (client side rendering)

## SSG & SSR Benefits

- prerendering improves performance
- better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

## Prerequisite

- having a good understanding of React
- Nodejs installed on your computer
  (v 10.13 or later)
- [Github]

## Getting Started

installing nextjs

```
> npx create-next-app my-app
```

Running our Application

```
> npm run dev
