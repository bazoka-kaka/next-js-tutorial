# Redirecting Users

You sometimes wanna redirect a user without them clicking on a link, for example when user submitted a form.
<br><br>
now, we wanna do auto redirecting, which is after 3 seconds of 404 page, the user will be redirected back to the homepage.
<br><br>
here, we're gonna use useEffect hook.
<br><br>
useEffect fires a function when the component first mounts (when the user first sees the 404 page in the browser).
<br><br>
we're also gonna use useRouter
which gives access to a method that we can use to redirect the user

## useEffect

you have to import it first:

```
import {useEffect} from 'react';
```

example of useEffect:

```
useEffect(() => {

}, [])
```

the first argument (the function)will be fired when the function first mount (when we first see it in the browser).
<br><br>
The second argument (the empty array/the dependency array), if it's empty, it's saying: only fire the function once when the component first mount and not again if any state changes.

## useRouter

we have to import it first

```
import {useRouter} from 'next/router';
```

example of useRouter:

```
const router = useRouter();
useEffect(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    router.go(-1);
  }, 3000)
}, []);
```

<code>router.go()</code> method allows us to go back and forth to the history. if the value is "-1" then it'll be redirected to the previous page. if it's "+1" then it'll go forth.
<br><br>
But, if we wanna goto a certain page, we can use the <code>router.push()</code> method instead.

```
const router = useRouter();
useEffect(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    router.push('/');
  }, 3000)
}, []);
```
